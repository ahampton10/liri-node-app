# liri-node-app

## Assignment Overview
In this assignment, you will make LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

## Expected Results
 This app was designed to produce search results based on the following commands: 
 * node liri.js concert-this 
 ** This command will call upon the Bands in Town API to display searched artist/band name, the venue of their next concert, the location, and the date and time of the concert. 
 * node liri.js spotify-this-song
 ** This command will call upon the Spotify API to display searched artist, song, album, and Spotify URL.  
 * node liri.js movie-this
 ** This command will call upon the OMDb API to display searched movie title, year the movie was released, IMDb rating, Rotten tomates rating, country in which the movie was produced, language, plot, and cast members. 
 * node liri.js do-what-it says
 ** Prints the Spotify results for "I Want it That Way" which is stored in the random.txt file.
